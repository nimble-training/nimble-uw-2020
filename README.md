## Installing NIMBLE

NIMBLE is an R package on CRAN, so in general it will be straightforward to install as with any R package, but you do need a compiler and related tools on your system.  

In summary, here are the steps.

1. Install compiler tools on your system. [https://r-nimble.org/download](https://r-nimble.org/download) has more details on how to install *Rtools* on Windows and how to install the command line tools of *Xcode* on a Mac. Note that if you have packages requiring a compiler (e.g., *Rcpp*) on your computer, you should already have the compiler tools installed.

2. Install the *nimble* package from CRAN in the usual fashion for an R package. More details (including troubleshooting tips) can also be found in Section 4 of the [NIMBLE manual](https://r-nimble.org/html_manual/cha-installing-nimble.html).

3) To test that things are working please run the following code  in R:

```
library(nimble)
code <- nimbleCode({
  y ~ dnorm(0,1)
})
model <- nimbleModel(code)
cModel <- compileNimble(model)
```

If that runs without error, you're all set. If not, please see the troubleshooting tips and email me directly if you can't get things going.
