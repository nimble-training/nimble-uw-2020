# Exercises

 1. Set up the model code and run an MCMC on a model of interest to you.

 2. Experiment with various MCMC samplers on a model of interest to you.

 3. Write a user-defined zero-inflated Poisson distribution and check that you can use it in a model. For a solution to this problem, please see [this example on our webpage](https://r-nimble.org/nimbleExamples/zero_inflated_poisson.html).

 4. Chat with me about your model of interest and using NIMBLE.
