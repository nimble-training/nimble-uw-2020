One-dimensional MCMC: generating a sequential sample 
=====

- MCMC generates a sequentially dependent (i.e., auto-correlated) sample whose stationary distribution is the "target" distribution (e.g. posterior), $p(\theta|y)$.

- There are lots of ways to do this, all within the MCMC family of algorithms.

- Often, one cycles through the parameters, sampling a parameter or set of parameters conditional on the other parameters and the data. (This is known generically as "Gibbs" sampling.)

- Usually only the part of the total model density that involves a particular parameter(s) (e.g. intercept) needs to be calculated when sampling that parameter(s).

- Some methods also use derivatives of $p(\theta|y)$. 

- Different methods require different numbers of calculations per iteration, so some are slow and some are fast.

- Different methods mix differently.

- Mixing is how well they move around the distribution.

Alternating dimensions and blocking dimensions
=====

Suppose we need a posterior sample for (intercept, slope).

Two options:

  1. Alternate:

    - Sample slope while holding intercept fixed (conditioning).
    - Sample intercept while holding slope fixed.

     This is valid.
    
  2. Sample slope and intercept at the same time.  This is *blocking*.

Conjugate samplers (also called "Gibbs")
=====

- Possible when we can write, e.g., P(intercept | slope, data) analytically.
- This only works for particular prior-posterior combinations.
- Despite sounding simple, there is some computational cost.
- Both JAGS and NIMBLE use conjugate samplers by default when available.


Other samplers in nimble
=====
- random-walk Metropolis-Hastings sampler (adaptive)
- slice sampler
- binary (for Bernoulli variables)
- categorical (these are *costly*).
- posterior predictive sampler (for no dependencies)
- elliptical slice sampler (for certain MVN cases).
- CAR (conditional autoregression model) normal sampler
- CAR proper sampler
- random-walk multinomial sampler (adaptive)
- random-walk Dirichlet sampler (adaptive)
- cross-level sampler
- `RW_llFunction` A random-walk Metropolis-Hastings that calls any log-likelihood function you provide.
- Particle MCMC samplers.

Other samplers (not currently in NIMBLE)
=====

Samplers that use derivatives:

- Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

    - Good mixing but at very high computational cost.
    
- Langevin samplers

    - Use one gradient evaluation to make a good MH proposal density.
    
These samplers will be supported in NIMBLE in the coming year.  They work now in development versions.

Mixing and computation time are both important
=====

Mixing refers to how well the MCMC samples around the posterior ("target distribution").

Computation time refers to the time taken by the MCMC.

Efficiency = Effective sample size / computation time.

Pace = 1/Efficiency

Some samplers run quickly but produce very autocorrelated chains.

Somes samplers produce less autocorrelated chains but run very slowly.


What is Effective Sample Size (ESS)
=====

- *Effective sample size (ESS)* is the equivalent number of
independent samples in an MCMC chain for one parameter.

# What does "equivalent number of independent samples" mean?

- If `x[i]` were drawn independently (m samples), we could say:

$\mbox{Var}[\overline{x}] = \mbox{Var}[ \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^m x[i] ]= \frac{\mbox{Var}[x[i]]}{m}$

- Instead, we have

$\mbox{Var}[\overline{x}] = \frac{\mbox{Var}[x[i]]}{\mbox{ESS}}$

where ESS is the *Effective Sample Size*.

coda provides `effectiveSize` to calculate this.

In general the effective sample size is considerably smaller than the number of samples.

Measuring MCMC performance: MCMC efficiency
=====

We define *MCMC efficiency* as

$\frac{\mbox{ESS}}{\mbox{computation time}}$

- This is the number of effectively independent samples generated per time.
- ESS is different for every parameter.
- Computation time is the same for every parameter: the total time.
- We do not count setup steps like model building and compilation as
  part of computation time.  Even
  though these take time, we are more interested in the final MCMC
  performance.
- One needs a reasonable sample just to get a reasonable estimate of ESS.
- We generally do not thin when comparing methods because thinning always removes some information from a sample.

A single number: Minimum MCMC efficiency
=====

- We want a single number to measure the performance of an MCMC.
- Often there are many fast-mixing parameters and one or a few
slow-mixing ones.
- We need all parameters to be mixed well to rely on results.
- Therefore our single measure of efficiency is:

**Net MCMC efficiency = Minimum MCMC efficiency over all parameters**

Vats et al (2019; Biometrika) presents a method for a multivariate ESS that is worth considering.

Why we don't care as much about mean MCMC efficiency
=====

- It is tempting to think mean (across parameters) of MCMC efficiency is a good measure of overall performance.
- If you rely on mean efficiency, you could end up like the statistician who drowned in a river with an average depth of three feet.
- If some parameters are mixing very well and others very poorly, one should be quite cautious about inference on the "well-mixed" ones, as the poor mixing of others indicates we haven't fully explored the posterior.
